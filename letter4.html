                Look at these washed up crabs! Lau! K bhaye cha hai? 
                Jiwan ma maybe they also thought about so many things,
                Maybe they wanted to go places! Maybe they tried to find another sea?
                But they got washed up somehere in Bangsaen haha. 
                In the vast expanse of this universe, if nothing really matters in the end, why stress out?
                <br>
                <br>
                Antya ma everything will be alright. Even if it means you will be washed up in Bangsaen,
                or maybe end  up in one of those high rise NY buildings, 
                everything will be okay at the end. 
                Ani! always remember . . . even if its the end of the world or the starting of a new one, 
                I will always be there beside you. Holding your hand.
