               You have given me so much Maya. 
               All i asked for was love. Ani you gave me so much of it. 
               Fully, wholly, completely, in love with you. 
               When you miss me dherai, just look up at the sky la?
               Theres always such a high chance that i am also looking at it. 
               I love the sky, there is so much on it and it expands beyond my comprehensibility. 
               Ani I love you, there is so much on us, and this love expands beyond anything. 
                <br>
                <br>
               Lastly, I have to confess maya. I dont miss you as much as you miss me! 
               I miss you way moreeeee
               Haha, I have always missed you. 
               Surya uddha, timro yaad ma uthchu.
               Din bhari khana khada, iskul jada, timro yaad aaucha. 
               "Maya k garira hola hai? Maya ramrari sutyo hola hai? I hope so"
               Ani sajha dhalkida ma ghar pharkinxu. Timi etai chau ni aile samma pani. 
               Mero lagi timi eta nai chau. Mero sano kotha ma. 
               Ma kotha ma huda timi toilet ma hunxau, ani ma toilet ma huda timi kotha. 
               kasto dukha hai, kaile kai timi salaya ma hunxau ani kailei Nepal ma.
               Tara you are always there.
               So I hope I am also here with you. Wherever you are, so will I be.
