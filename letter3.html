                Mayaaaa, is it raining outside? I hope you’re somewhere inside, warm and cozy all bundled up sirani ma. 
                Maya timilai yaad cha? Golf ma pani parda bardali bata hereko. Haat ma haat. I hope the next time it rains, we’re together. 
                We’d put on a simple song, sing together, you play your mandolin and I follow you on guitar.

                It’s so fun to get obliterated by the rain.
