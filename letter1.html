                Hi Maya!!! Mero priye, happy Valentineâ€™s Day ! 
                This is probably delayed because of past Jaya Shree not coding enough lol. 
                This year was so much fun, I loved the coloring parts and the puzzle, kati kati dherai.
                Ani I listen to bhanai almost everyday ajkal. It makes me feel like you are singing it to me and I am singing it to you. 
                Ani Maya, thaha cha, I realized something ni : ) I did not feel like our valentines was special! 
                And it is not because it was bad, of course not hehe. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I realized how much you do for me on every occasion, and every single day. 
                You make me feel so special and loved every day, that everyday feels accomplished. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you so much for everything Maya, for waking up as long as you can on call, for sleeping on call with me, 
                for all the times you have brought me flowers, for all the times you smiled at me, and much more. 
                I am grateful and honored to be your love, and the lover. 
            </p>
